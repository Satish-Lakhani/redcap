=REDCAP INSTALLATION GUIDE=

= Preface =
!RedCap installation on your gameserver is quite easy, but you must carefully follow this installation guide or !RedCap will not run properly.

  # Check the [http://code.google.com/p/redcap/w/edit/RedCap minimal requirements] to run !RedCap. If they are not satisfied you cannot run the !RedCap.

  # Unzip it on your local PC: a folder named *{{{Redcap_1.0_Beta_(yyyymmdd)}}}* will be created.
  # Suggestion: rename this folder with a easier name (i.e. RC10)
  # Open the file *{{{M_CONF.py}}}* and configure it as explained [http://code.google.com/p/redcap/wiki/RedCap_config_file here]. This is _a very important step_. If !RedCap is not properly configured it will hung up. Once *{{{M_CONF.py}}}* is properly configured do not forget to save it.
  # FTP transfer the entire !RedCap folder to your gameserver. It is strongly suggested to put the !RedCap folder into the same folder of gameserver log.
  # Assign execution permission (rwx-rw-rw or 755) to the following files: _{{{S_start.sh, S_prestart.sh, S_full_restart.sh}}}_
  # Check your server configuration file for
