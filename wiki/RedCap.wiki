#summary Redcap requirement and features list
[http://code.google.com/p/redcap/ <back to homepage]
= !RedCap requirements=
_if your server do not comply requirements 1, 2, 3, it will be *not* possible to run !RedCap unless your server Provider install it for you._

  # Python >2.5 installed on the server (It is standard on Linux based gameserver, to be verified on Windows based server)
  # Remote FTP access to the server
  # Possibility to remote start a script on the game server, or at least to modify the existing script starting Urban Terror.
  # Console remote access to the game server (ssh type) is *not* a must but it helps a lot.
  # *No* need of MySQL

= Features list=

  * Use authorization level individually customizable for each command.
  * Fully customizable configuration file (See [RedCap_config_file full configuration guide]).
